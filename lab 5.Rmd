## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## 1. Read in the data

```{r packages}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r stations-data, cache=TRUE}
# Download the data
stations <- fread("ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.csv")
stations[, USAF := as.integer(USAF)]
# Dealing with NAs and 999999
stations[, USAF   := fifelse(USAF == 999999, NA_integer_, USAF)]
stations[, CTRY   := fifelse(CTRY == "", NA_character_, CTRY)]
stations[, STATE  := fifelse(STATE == "", NA_character_, STATE)]
# Selecting the three relevant columns, and keeping unique records
stations <- unique(stations[, list(USAF, CTRY, STATE)])
# Dropping NAs
stations <- stations[!is.na(USAF)]
# Removing duplicates
stations[, n := 1:.N, by = .(USAF)]
stations <- stations[n == 1,][, n := NULL]
```


```{r data-read, cache=TRUE}
if (!file.exists("../met_all.gz"))
  download.file(
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/02_met/met_all.gz",
    destfile = "../met_all.gz",
    method   = "libcurl",
    timeout  = 60
    )
met <- data.table::fread("../met_all.gz")
```

Merging the data

```{r merging}
met <- merge(
  x = met,
  y = stations,
  all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE,
  by.x = "USAFID", by.y = "USAF"
)
```

## Question 1

First, generate a representative version of each station. We will use the averages (median could also be a good way to represent it, but it will depend on the case).

```{r collapsing-by-station}
station_averages <- met[,.(
  temp      = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),
  wind.sp   = mean(wind.sp, na.rm = TRUE),
  atm.press = mean(atm.press, na.rm = TRUE)
), by = .(USAFID)]
```

Now, we need to identify the median per variable

```{r quantiles}
medians <- station_averages[,.(
  temp_50      = quantile(temp, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE),
  wind.sp_50   = quantile(wind.sp, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE),
  atm.press_50 = quantile(atm.press, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE)
)]
medians
```

Now we can find the stations that are the closest to these. (hint: `which.min()`)

```{r median-temp}
station_averages[, temp_dist := abs(temp - medians$temp_50)]
median_temp_station <- station_averages[order(temp_dist)][1]
median_temp_station
```

The median temperature station is `r median_temp_station$USAFID`.

## Question 2

We first need to recover the state variable, by MERGING :)!

```{r}
station_averages <- merge(
  x = station_averages, y = stations,
  by.x = "USAFID", by.y = "USAF",
  all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE
  )
```

Now we can compute the median per state

```{r}
station_averages[, temp_50 := quantile(temp, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE), by = STATE]
station_averages[, wind.sp_50 := quantile(wind.sp, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE), by = STATE]
```

Now, the euclidean distance... $\sqrt{\sum_i(x_i - y_i)^2}$

```{r}
station_averages[, eudist := sqrt(
  (temp - temp_50)^2 + (wind.sp - wind.sp_50)^2
  )]
station_averages
```

## Question 3

## Question 4

Going back to the met dataset.

```{r}
met[, state_temp := mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), by = STATE]
met[, temp_cat := fifelse(
  state_temp < 20, "low-temp", 
  fifelse(state_temp < 25, "mid-temp", "high-temp"))
  ]
```

Let's make sure that we don't have NAs

```{r}
table(met$temp_cat, useNA = "always")
```

Now, let's summarize

```{r}
tab <- met[, .(
  N_entries  = .N,
  N_stations = length(unique(USAFID))
), by = temp_cat]
knitr::kable(tab)
```
